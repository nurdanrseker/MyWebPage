      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project was developed as part of the Interaction in Virtual and Augmented Reality (2024/2025) course. The main objective of the course was to explore and implement one of the known locomotion techniques in an immersive virtual environment using Meta Quest 2.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Traditional VR applications often struggle with natural movement, especially when it comes to large virtual spaces. Inspired by horseback riding as a natural and intuitive locomotion method, I aimed to design a virtual experience that simulates horse riding in VR.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Problem Statement</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Locomotion in Virtual Reality (VR) remains a major challenge in immersive system design. Many VR experiences rely on teleportation or joystick-based navigation â€” methods that often break immersion, lack realism, and can induce motion sickness. These techniques also reduce physical engagement and create a disconnect between player input and perceived movement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The core motivation of this project was to explore a more &lt;strong&gt;natural and physically intuitive locomotion method&lt;/strong&gt;, inspired by a real-world activity: &lt;strong&gt;horse riding&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
