Locomotion in Virtual Reality (VR) remains a major challenge in immersive system design. Many VR experiences rely on teleportation or joystick-based navigation — methods that often break immersion, lack realism, and can induce motion sickness. These techniques also reduce physical engagement and create a disconnect between player input and perceived movement.

The core motivation of this project was to explore a more **natural and physically intuitive locomotion method**, inspired by a real-world activity: **horse riding**.

Specifically, the project addresses the following key issues:

1. **Unnatural Locomotion Patterns**  
   Traditional input methods like thumbsticks do not reflect how people move in real life, reducing the sense of presence.

2. **Low Physical Involvement**  
   Existing methods require minimal body movement, resulting in passive interaction that decreases embodiment.

3. **Motion Sickness and Disorientation**  
   Abrupt or artificial motion transitions often cause discomfort or nausea during extended VR use.

To tackle these issues, the project implements a **reins-based gesture system** using Meta Quest 2 controllers, simulating the feel of horse riding. The aim was to enhance physical embodiment, user comfort, and immersion through rhythmic, body-driven motion — offering an **engaging alternative to conventional VR locomotion techniques**.
