To assess the effectiveness and usability of the VR Horse Riding system, I conducted a user study with 4 participants. After experiencing the game on Meta Quest 2, participants responded to a 12-question survey evaluating aspects such as comfort, immersion, controls, responsiveness, and overall enjoyment.

###  Key Takeaways

- **Comfort & Immersion:** Nearly all users rated physical comfort and immersion highly, indicating that the reins-based locomotion technique is both engaging and physically non-intrusive.

- **Control & Understanding:** All participants quickly understood how to control the horse using virtual reins, and found the interaction intuitive.

- **Game Objectives:** Objectives such as collecting coins and completing the course loop were universally considered clear and satisfying.

- **Challenge & Responsiveness:** Some participants felt the game was not particularly challenging and that movement responsiveness could be slightly improved. These are valuable indicators for future iterations.

### User Feedback

During testing, it was noticeable that players felt less discomfort when they focused on collecting coins rather than looking around the environment. This suggests that keeping attention on nearby elements may help reduce motion sickness in VR.


### Conclusion

The VR Horse Riding system demonstrated strong performance in comfort, usability, and immersion. Participants enjoyed the experience and expressed a willingness to replay and recommend the game. While the game mechanics were well received, challenge and feedback responsiveness are areas for potential enhancement in future versions.
