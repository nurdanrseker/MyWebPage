This project was developed as part of the Interaction in Virtual and Augmented Reality (2024/2025) course. The main objective of the course was to explore and implement one of the known locomotion techniques in an immersive virtual environment using Meta Quest 2.

Traditional VR applications often struggle with natural movement, especially when it comes to large virtual spaces. Inspired by horseback riding as a natural and intuitive locomotion method, I aimed to design a virtual experience that simulates horse riding in VR.

My motivation stemmed from two key points:

1. **Physical engagement**: I wanted to create a movement experience that feels more active and connected than simply using a joystick or teleportation.
2. **Immersion**: The rhythm of a horse and the environmental setting could amplify immersion and provide a novel locomotion alternative in VR design.

The result is the **VR Horse Riding Project**, where users control a virtual horse using hand gestures resembling real-world rein handling.
