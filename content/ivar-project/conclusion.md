Based on technical implementation and user feedback, the VR Horse Riding project achieved its primary goal: exploring and implementing an alternative, physically intuitive locomotion method in Virtual Reality using Meta Quest 2.


Overall, the project achieved its primary goals:

- Players were able to **navigate using physical gestures** instead of thumbsticks or teleportation  
- The interaction model was found to be **intuitive and enjoyable**  
- **Immersion and comfort** levels were consistently high across participants

However, one factor emerged as particularly important during testing:  
 **Motion sickness is closely tied to visual focus and environmental awareness.**

Participants reported that **looking around freely increased discomfort**, while **focusing on nearby, central elements like coin collection** helped them feel more stable and less nauseous. This insight highlights the deep connection between **visual attention and vestibular feedback** in VR locomotion.


### What's Next?

While the project met its core objectives, thereâ€™s still room to enhance the experience:
- Explore **eye-tracking** or **dynamic focus systems** to help reduce motion sickness
- Introduce **adaptive difficulty** or **timed challenges** to boost engagement  
- Add **more diverse environments or levels** to increase variety  
- Further refine **gesture responsiveness** to improve control precision
